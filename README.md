# offensive-scripts
A collection of Python scripts for Red Teaming or otherwise.

You might be asking, why bother since there's plenty of them around already. First of all, it was fun to write them, but also I wanted something I had full control and understanding and they worked easily on all platforms from Linux to iOS.

I tend to keep these files handy on my Apple devices case I want to do some quick checks on the go. They are fully compatible with Pythonista and other similar python environments.

|Script                | Description                                          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
|ftp_scanner.py| Find open & anonymous FTP servers (use "-h" for more)|
|ssh_scanner.py| SSH login bruteforcer|
|dns_scanner.py| Extended DNS lookup tool with a few twists|
|port_scanner.py| Dirty simple port scanner that utilizes the other scripts here|
|prettyprint.py| Just a beautification library, look at the code for examples|
|ipmagic.py| Manipulate IPs using WHOIS information|
|bg_nmap.sh            | Stupid little script to automate nmap scans and put them in a TMUX session |
